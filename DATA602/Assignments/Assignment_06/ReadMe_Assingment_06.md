### Assignment Description
Using the attached file, you are going to get experience using grid search and cross-validation.

Directions:

Create a new repo in your GitHub for DATA602. It should contain:
a brief readme
data folder with the attached data
your notebook
Using the attached data, create a Jupyter Notebook
Inspect the data and create a pipeline to perform any feature processing
Prior to building the feature pipeline, be sure to split the data into training/test sets
Create a logistic regression model pipeline that uses the above pipeline
Pick a metric you are going to use to select the model and justify your choice.
Use the above combined pipeline to run a Logistic Regression model with grid search cross-validation using 10 folds. Search 5 different regularization strengths and 2 solvers. What is the best model? How does it perform on the test set?


The variable you should be predicting in the 'Class' column.
